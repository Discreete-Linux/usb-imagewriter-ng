usb-imagewriter-ng (0.1-1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Fork of the original usb-imagewriter with several enhancements
  * Convert interface from libglade to  GtkBuilder
  * Check target size (LP: #714208, #364195)
  * Use pv instead of dd for copying and progress watching. Removes the need 
    for a shell wrapper. As a side effect, fixes several problems with file
    path handling which were incorrectly handled by the shell.
    (LP: #400522, #630979)
  * Optional verification pass
  * Sync after writing, wait for sync to complete. This fixes rare
    errors with targets which are only several bytes too small, where dd
    would return while some data is still in the buffers. Should now
    happen only on drives which report incorrect size.
  * Added CLI options for source, target and immediate start, to allow
    the use in scripted (mass) writing
  * Added .iso and .raw to the file chooser filter, eases writing
    isohybrid images (LP: #615179)

usb-imagewriter (0.1.3-0ubuntu4) karmic; urgency=low

  * revert the changes to the pipe commands, they completely break interaction
    with the shell wrapper and make imagewriter completely non-functional. the
    shell in the pipes is needed for the wrapper script that uses watch to
    generate input for the progress bar.

usb-imagewriter (0.1.3-0ubuntu3) karmic; urgency=critical

  * lib/imagewriter.py: New patch to handle spaces in image path (LP: #366607)
     - This patch fixes a possible command-injection security error, which is
       the reason for the urgency=critical.
     - Removed encapsulation in quotes from line 101, as described in the lower
       change, because that would fail if the path contained quotes.
     - Used a proper argument list instead of string in both Popen statements.
     - Changed shell=True to shell=False because it is no longer needed.

       quotes so that it can be used with "ls -l" and "dd" commands
       even if the path includes spaces.
